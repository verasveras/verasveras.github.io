        <p><b><font size="14"></font>About Me</font></b></p>
        <p>I'm a New York City native who recently migrated over to Seattle in order to expand my horizons. In 2015 I graduated with a BA in Physics from Barnard College. While working as a research assistant I discovered the joy of programming and haven't turned back since. </p>
        <p>I am a social creature and enjoy working with others. I learn best when I am challenged by my peers and am always looking for people who know more than me or have a different area of expertise. Life is a constant opportunity to grow and I am interested in growing as much as a can, both as a programmer and a person. </p>
        <p> When I'm not programming, I am an avid weight lifter, reader, and cook. I love to unwind by playing a good board game or teaming up to play sports. If you'd like play a game of Chess, talk programming, or just say hi, feel free to email me. I will always get back to you at lisaveras@gmail.com.</p>
